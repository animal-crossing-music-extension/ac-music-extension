# Animal Crossing Music 🍀

**Animal Crossing Music** is a fun Chrome extension for playing Animal Crossing's music in the browser, while you work, play or browse the web! ✨

The music updates in real-time on the hour, and informs you via an optional desktop notification and customizable town tune! 🌱

## Features
### Hourly Music 🕒
Listen to the corresponding hourly music from the main Animal Crossing titles:
  - Animal Crossing
  - Wild World / City Folk
  - New Leaf
  - New Horizons

'Raining' and 'snowing' variants are also included!

### Live Weather 🌧
You can enable the "Live Weather" function so weather variants of the hourly music can be automatically picked according to the weather in your specified location!

### K.K. Slider 🎙
Listen to K.K. Slider's songs! The extension features both 'live' and 'aircheck' version of his tunes.

You can choose whether to keep his appearances to the usual Saturday nights, or to play his songs 24/7.

### Town Tune 🎵
The extension features an awesome Town Tune editor available within the browser.

With it you can compose your custom Town Tune, which will be played every time an hour passes, just like the games!
